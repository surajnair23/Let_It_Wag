The app has a report stray animal form, wherein the user can mention the last spotted location of the pet.  
It is then upon the NGO administration to start a work flow to pickup the pet and later provide medical treatment for the pet.  
Since there are a lot of stray animals, we have implemented the ordering of supplies at the pet shelter after the 
necessary administrative approvals
